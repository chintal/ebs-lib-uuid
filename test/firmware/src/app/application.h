/**
 * @file application.h
 * @brief Application configuration parameters.
 *
 * This file, and the file hierarchy that it includes, should define
 * all the parameters necessary for configuring all inlcuded C code. 
 * This hierarchy should not possess any functional code within itself, 
 * and is to be used only as an in-code configuration store. It should 
 * only add preprocessor files and definitions and should not create 
 * any compilable code. It should be safe to include within _any_ file, 
 * and when included, provides all the compile-time preprocessor switches
 * necessary to correctly compile / link the appropriate code. 
 * 
 * All other source files should include this file, with the exception of
 * files within the uC HAL implementation, which will include this file
 * via hal_uc_map.h, which additionally processes the definitions here 
 * to provide 'calculated' compile time parameters. 
 * 
 * The lower level files in this hierarchy should not be included 
 * separately, and the information present in them should be accessed
 * only though this file.
